# AirBnB Clone
# Phase: Console

## Description

This project involves the creation of a powerful console, which serves as a
fundamental component for handling data and storage operations. The console
acts as an interface for users to interact with the application's data and 
enables various essential functionalities such as creating, updating, 
and deleting objects.

## Features

- Data Model Creation: The console facilitates the creation of a well-defined 
data model that outlines the structure and relationships of the application's data.

- Object Management: Through the command-line interface, users can effectively 
manage objects, including creating, updating, and deleting them. This 
functionality provides a user-friendly approach to data manipulation.

- JSON File Storage: The console incorporates a robust storage system 
that ensures the persistent storage of objects in a JSON file. This storage 
abstraction allows for seamless handling of data without direct consideration 
of the underlying storage mechanism.

- Abstraction Layer: The storage engine provides an abstraction layer 
between the application's objects and their storage, enabling easy modification
of the storage type without extensive updates to the codebase.

- Validation Tool: The console serves as a tool to validate the efficiency
and functionality of the storage engine, ensuring that data manipulation and 
storage operations work as intended.

## Getting Started

To run the console, execute console.py and 
follow the instructions provided within the console interface.

## Usage

The console allows users to perform various operations on the application's 
data, including the following key functionalities:

- Creating new objects
- Updating existing objects
- Deleting specific objects
- Retrieving and displaying information about objects
- Managing data persistence through JSON file storage
